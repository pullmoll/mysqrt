Why a perfect cuboid‘s √(a² + b² + c²) ≠ d, where a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ.

1. The sides of a primitive rectangular triangle, i.e. the primitive
Pythagorean Triples (pPT), always consist of one odd length cathetus,
one even length cathetus, and the odd length hypotenuse.

2. Every general rectangular triangle, i.e. every general Pythagorean Triple
(PT), is in exactly one way the multiple of a pPT and a factor f ∈ ℕ.

3. The PT in a cuboid with edge lengths a, b, and c are:

	a, b, √(a²+b²)
	a, c, √(a²+c²)
	b, c, √(b²+c²)

4. The length of the space diagonal in a cuboid is:

	 √(a² + b² + c²) = d

5. Because of the commutativity of the addends inside the square root on the
left side of this equation each of the following three equations is equivalent:

	√(√(b² + c²)² + a²) = d
	√(√(a² + c²)² + b²) = d
	√(√(a² + b²)² + c²) = d

Every inner square root is the length of the hypotenuse of a PT and thus the
multiple of an odd number.

It follows that each of a, b, and c on the right side in the three equations
needs to be a multiple of an even number to meet the condition for a PT.

On the other hand in the inner square roots in each case exactly one of a, b,
or c needs to be the multiple of an odd number.

Reductio ad absurdum.
