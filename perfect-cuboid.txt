Why a perfect cuboid‘s √(a² + b² + c²) ≠ d, where a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ.

1. The sides of a primitive rectangular triangle, i.e. the
primitive Pythagorean Triples (pPT), always consist of one
odd length cathetus, one even length cathetus, and the odd
length hypotenuse.

2. Every general rectangular triangle, i.e. every general
Pythagorean Triple (PT), is in exactly one way the multiple
of a pPT and a factor f ∈ ℕ.

Because of the commutativity of the addends inside the square root
on the left side of

	 √(a² + b² + c²) = d

each of

	√(√(b² + c²) + a²) = d
	√(√(a² + c²) + b²) = d
	√(√(a² + b²) + c²) = d

is equivalent. d is the length of the space diagonal of the perfect cuboid.

Every inner square root result is the length of the hypotenuse of a PT
and thus the multiple of an odd number.

It follows that each of a, b, and c in the three equations needs to
be a multiple of an even number to meet the condition for PT.

On the other hand in the inner square roots in each case exactly
one of a, b, or c needs to be the multiple of an odd number.

Reductio ad absurdum.
