Why a perfect cuboid‘s √(a² + b² + c²) ≠ d, where a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ.

1) The sides of every primitive rectangular triangle are the primitive
Pythagorean Triples (pPT). They always consist of one odd length cathetus,
one even length cathetus, and the odd length hypotenuse.

2) Every general rectangular triangle is a general Pythagorean Triple (PT).
It is in exactly one way the multiple of a pPT and a factor F ∈ ℕ.

3) The PT of the face triangles of a cuboid with edge lengths a, b, and c are:
	3.1)	a, b, √(a²+b²)
	3.2)	a, c, √(a²+c²)
	3.3)	b, c, √(b²+c²)

4) The even and odd cathetus of each pair of the pPT generating these PT are
connected in one of two possible configurations.
Here e means the even length and o the odd length cathetus:
	4.1)	e↔o	e↔o	e↔o
	4.2)	e↔e	e↔o	o↔o

In a theoretical minimum solution of a perfect cuboid the configuration 4.1 is
impossible because, independently of the three factors for the PT, the resulting
cuboid will always be divisible by 2, which contradicts the assumption of
a minimum solution.

5) The length of the space diagonal in a cuboid is:
	 √(a² + b² + c²) = d

6) Because of the commutativity of the addends inside the square root on the left
side of this equation each of the following three equations is equivalent:

	6.1)	√(√(b² + c²)² + a²) = d
	6.2)	√(√(a² + c²)² + b²) = d
	6.3)	√(√(a² + b²)² + c²) = d

Every inner square root is the length of the hypotenuse of a PT and thus the multiple
of an odd number, which is the hypotenuse of the generating pPT.

It follows that each of a, b, and c on the right side in these three equations need
to be a multiple of an even number to meet the condition for the pPT generating the PT.

On the other hand in the inner square roots in each case exactly one of a, b, or c
needs to be the multiple of an odd number.

Reductio ad absurdum.
