Why the perfect cuboid's √(a² + b² + c²) ≠ d, where a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ.

1. The sides of a primitive rectangular triangle, i.e. the primitive
Pythagorean Triples (pPT), always consist of one odd length cathetus,
one even length cathetus, and the odd length hypotenuse.

2. Every general rectangular triangle, i.e. every general Pythagorean
Triple (PT), is in exactly one way the multiple of a pPT and a
factor f ∈ ℕ.

Because of the commutativity of the addends inside the square root
on the left side of

	 √(a² + b² + c²) = d

each of

	√(√(a² + b²) + c²) = d
	√(√(a² + c²) + b²) = d
	√(√(b² + c²) + a²) = d

is equivalent.

Every inner square root‘s result is the length of the hypotenuse of a
PT and thus the multiple of an odd number. As a consequence each of c,
b, and a in the three equations would have to be a multiple of an even
number to meet the condition for PT.
